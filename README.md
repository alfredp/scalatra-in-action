This repository contains the sample code for the Scalatra in Action book.

Each chapter has a code listing. The instructions for building the listings
boils down to:

* have a JDK installed
* change into the top-level directory of the application (e.g. "cd ch02/scalachat").
* make sure the file "sbt" is executable (i.e. "chmod +x sbt" on *nix), or that you've installed sbt if you're on Windows.
* run sbt: "./sbt" (on *nix) or "sbt" (on Windows). This will download a large number of dependencies.
* type "container:start" at the sbt prompt
* visit the running application in your browser, at http://localhost:8080
